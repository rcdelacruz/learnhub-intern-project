# LearnHub - E-Learning Platform

Welcome to LearnHub, a comprehensive e-learning platform built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and modern development practices. This documentation will guide you through setting up, developing, and deploying the platform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

LearnHub is designed as a collaborative training project for 7 interns, where each intern develops a specific module while working together on a unified platform. The project uses the latest technologies including Node.js 22 LTS and Drizzle ORM for optimal performance and developer experience.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each intern owns a specific module (Course Management, Student Management, etc.)
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Production Ready**: Complete CI/CD pipeline, testing, and deployment strategies
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live updates and notifications
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for every aspect of development

    A --> F[Real-time WebSocket]
    G[Authentication] --> A
    H[File Storage] --> A
```

### Module Structure

Each module follows the same structure:
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Database Models**: Drizzle schema definitions with full TypeScript support
- **UI Components**: React components for user interfaces
- **Business Logic**: Service layer for complex operations
- **Tests**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests

## üë• Module Assignment

| Module | Intern | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Course Management | Intern #1 | Course creation, curriculum design, content organization |
| Student Management | Intern #2 | Student profiles, progress tracking, enrollment |
| Instructor Management | Intern #3 | Instructor tools, course authoring, analytics |
| Assessment System | Intern #4 | Quizzes, exams, grading, anti-cheating |
| Communication System | Intern #5 | Forums, messaging, notifications, Q&A |
| Payment & Enrollment | Intern #6 | Billing, subscriptions, enrollment workflow |
| Analytics & Reporting | Intern #7 | Platform metrics, insights, custom reports |

git clone https://github.com/rcdelacruz/learnhub-intern-project.git
cd learnhub-intern-project
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your values
```

4. **Start development environment**
```bash
# With Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or manually
npm run dev
```

5. **Initialize database**
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed  # Optional: add sample data
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
